# csv-uploader-nodejs

CSV Uploader NodeJS is a simple Node.js application that allows users to upload CSV files to a remote server. The application is written in JQuery, EJS and uses the Express framework.

The application has two main features:

Uploading CSV files: Users can upload CSV files to the server by providing a file path or by dragging and dropping the file into the browser window.
Viewing uploaded CSV files: Once a CSV file has been uploaded, users can view the contents of the file by clicking on a link.
The application is also configured to store the uploaded CSV files in a database. This allows users to view the files even if they delete the file from their local computer.

The application is still under development, but it is a useful tool for uploading and viewing CSV files.

Here are some additional details about the project:

The application is hosted on GitHub Pages.
The code is open source.
